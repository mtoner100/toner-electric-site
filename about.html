                Toner Electric is a family owned and operated Electrical Contractor. The late Richard Toner
                founded the company in 1952 and opened for business in Newport, RI. Richard performed commercial
                and residential installations throughout Newport County and the Newport Naval Base.
              </p>
              <p>
                Richard continued to run a small shop until his nephew, Frank Toner Sr., took over the company in
                1978. Frank Sr. incorporated Toner Electric Company and operated a one-man operation from his home
                in Middletown for several years until his sons Frank Jr. and Scott entered the business.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1987 the business was moved to 305 Oliphant Ln in Middletown, RI, as the company began to grow.
                In 2010, Frank Sr. retired and his sons took over as the new owners. Frank Toner Jr. is the President
                and Scott Toner is the Vice President. Frank Sr. remains involved as a part-time consultant.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the third generation of Toner Electric Company, we look forward to continuing our tradition of
                quality workmanship for customers in Newport, RI, and surrounding towns.

          <p>
            Richie founded Toner Electric Company in 1952 when he opened for business at 62 West Broadway 
            (now Dr. Marcus Wheatland Boulevard) in Newport. He started doing residential work and then moved 
            on to commercial, municipal, and US Navy contracting. He retired in 1978.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his spare time, Richie was a pilot, thoroughbred horse enthusiast, and amateur historian, 
            particularly interested in Abraham Lincoln, the Civil War, and Hollywood producers. After he retired, 
            he started every day with a two-mile walk. He passed away in 2000 at age 82.
